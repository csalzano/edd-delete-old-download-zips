# Easy Digital Downloads - Delete Old Download Zips

Add-on for Easy Digital Downloads. Deletes .zip files from Media Library that are no longer associated with downloads.

> [!WARNING]
> Use at your own risk. Test results in a copy of your site first. I've tested this exactly one time on my site that sells WordPress plugin zip files, and it worked exactly as I expected.

When I launch a new version of a plugin I sell in EDD, the previous version remains in the Media Library. I wrote this plugin to delete those orphaned .zip files.

There is no reason to leave this plugin active or installed on your site. The clean up happens during plugin activation. Deactivate and delete after running.
